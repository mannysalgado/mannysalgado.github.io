                “Racism is associated with a host of psychological consequences, including depression,
                anxiety, and other serious, sometimes debilitating conditions, including post-traumatic
                stress disorder and substance use disorders. Moreover, the stress caused by racism
                can contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease and other physical
                diseases.”
              </p>
              <h3>Evidence</h3>
              <p>
                Science backs this up, too: In 2016, researchers from Manchester University in the UK
                specifically looked at how repeated and systemic racism over time could impact your
                mental health. Using data from Understanding Society, a tool designed to help
                researchers gather statistics and answers from study participants over time, the
                scientists examined feedback from ethnic minorities in the UK. This included their
                experiences being shouted at, being physically attacked, avoiding a place, and feeling
                unsafe because of their ethnicity.

                Racism can take a serious toll on someone's mental health. Discrimination related stress is linked to mental health
                issues. Fake
                news. But if you’re a minority , experiencing racism and discrimination is often all the negative effects of racism,

                minority or the reasoning of protests being shown on news channels. It could take a serious toll on mental mind,

                      Mental health can be caused by racism and fake news does not make it any
                      better. "Theexperience of racism – both direct and indirect inthe form of
                      microaggressions or exposure to racism via the media – can have a devastating
                      effect on the mental health of black people. This Effect – known as “racial
                      trauma” – can lead to depression,hypervigilance, chronic stress and fatigue,
                      bodily inflammation, and symptoms similar to post-traumatic stress disorder."
                      This supports my essay because it is a more in-depth explanation and a good
                      way to grasp what the topic of the essay will be about. The collidison offalse
                      reports and racism can not only causedepression and anxiety but suicide. With
                      the pressure of the media trying to judge someone's action even when it is a
                      sensitive topic like racism,it is like someone is lingering behind you always
                      silently judging. This can cause so much stresson the mental toll it can cause for
                      theperson to commit suicide for the feeling “not enough.’“Racism has also been
                      linked to the highsuicide rates and substance abuse among members ofthe
                      Native American population, andparticularly among its young adults. Steadily
                      increasing since 2003, Native Americans are more than 3.5 times more likely to
                      take their own life.

                      maybe even abuse. By helping people understand for the future, schools should teach
                      children and have them understand that every action does have consequences even if it
                      seems small to themselves. Help the elderly live a more peaceful lifestyle we should talk
                      to them in a way they can understand. A good majority might not understand that they
                      can find help on their smartphones. Making them more aware of the technology they
                      have might lead to finding treatments and or preventing a mental illness to progress.

                      Some people might not think mental health isn't that big of a problem and it is easy to
                      cope with. "the effects of racism on an individual's mental health occur as a result of
                      stress. The Stress response, or the “fight, flight, or freeze''response, is how the body
                      prepares to escape from danger."I made this counterargument because I feel like
                      people would think it be "easy" to cope with racism. That is being naive, if the media is
                      bashing a race you associate yourself with the majority of the time you will be on the
                      defensive side. For example not all hispancis areMexicans. Not all Mexicans are
                      gangsters or are doing the cartel. Which is obviously not "easy"to deal with; there are
                      some long-term and short-term effects of the mental toll. Saying it wasn't that hard
                      made it easier to show how wrong and howwe have less racism in the world.

                Overall, people leaving their mental health and physical health untreated, it can cause severe
                emotional and behavioral problems such as an increase in the risk of depression, anxiety, substance abuse,
                and to severe physical illness. Schools should be able to discuss mental illness more and the news should
                discuss ways in which you can prevent mental illness/treatments for it. Some treatments for mental
                illnesses may include psychotherapy, medication, case management (coordinates services for an
                individual with the help of a case manager), support groups, and a self help plan (your own strategies to
                help address your own health plan). These treatments don’t work for everyone, obviously individuals can
                determine what combination works best for them. Racism with the help of fake news sources can cause
                mental health problems Fake news and racism are real things. Racism does not only affect America but
                everywhere in the world. How to cope and why the minorities targeted more than any other people.
                Racism affects the mental health of any individual and there are ways to stop it. There are many fake and
                misleading news stories related to medical treatments and major diseases like cancer or diabetes. Trusting
                these false stories could lead you to make decisions that may be harmful to your health. Affecting the
                mental toll since it could be harder to accept the truth even if being misled. Going to a therapist or calling
                a number (111) to help with mental issues about anything whether it is the pressure of racism or current
                events.
